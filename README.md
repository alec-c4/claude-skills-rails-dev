## 💡 How It Works

### Automatic Skill Selection

Claude analyzes your request and activates the appropriate skill:

```
YOU: "Optimize the slow dashboard query"

CLAUDE: [Detects keywords: "optimize", "slow", "query"]
        [Activates: rails-analyst]

        Analyzing query performance...
        Found N+1 query...
        Adding eager loading...
```

### Multi-Skill Coordination

For complex tasks, `rails-project-manager` coordinates multiple skills:

```
YOU: "Build a commenting system"

CLAUDE: [Activates: rails-project-manager]

        Planning implementation...

        Stage 1: Model & Tests → rails-testing
        Stage 2: Business Logic → rails-business-logic
        Stage 3: API Endpoints → rails-api
        Stage 4: UI Components → rails-viewcomponents

        Starting Stage 1...
```

## 🎓 Core Principles

All skills follow these **NON-NEGOTIABLE** principles:

### 1. Test-First Development (TDD)
```ruby
# RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
# Write test first, make it pass, then improve
```

### 2. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
```ruby
# Don't create abstractions until actually needed
```

### 3. Convention Over Configuration
```ruby
# Follow Rails conventions unless compelling reason
```

### 4. Security by Design
```ruby
# Authorization, encryption, HTTPS by default
```

### 5. Incremental Progress
```ruby
# Every commit: compiles + tests pass + deployable
```
