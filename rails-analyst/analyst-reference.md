## Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### Complete Article Publishing Example

**JTBD Examples:**

1. **Content Creator:**
   - When I have a draft article ready, I want to publish it with one click, so I can share my ideas without technical hassle.

2. **Editor:**
   - When reviewing submissions, I want to see all pending articles in one place, so I can prioritize my review efficiently.

3. **Reader:**
   - When browsing articles, I want to filter by topic and author, so I can find content relevant to my interests quickly.

### Translating JTBD to Features

**JTBD:**
> When I have a draft article, I want to publish it with one click, so I can share without hassle.

**Derived Features:**
- One-click publish button
- Draft auto-save every 30 seconds
- Validation before publish
- Preview before publishing
- Scheduling for future publication
- SEO optimization suggestions
- Social media sharing integration

## Use Cases

### Detailed Use Case: Publish Article

```markdown
## Use Case: Publish Article

**Actor:** Content Creator (authenticated user with author role)
**Goal:** Publish a draft article to make it publicly visible
**Preconditions:**
- User is authenticated
- User has author role
- Draft article exists and belongs to user
- Article has minimum required fields (title, body, category)

### Main Flow:
1. User navigates to article edit page
2. User reviews article content in preview mode
3. User clicks "Publish" button
4. System validates article:
   - Title present and length 10-200 characters
   - Body present and minimum 100 characters
   - Category assigned
   - Featured image uploaded
5. System sets published_at to current timestamp
6. System sets status to "published"
7. System saves article to database
8. System redirects to published article page
9. System shows success message: "Article published successfully"
10. System sends notifications to subscribers (background job)

### Alternative Flows:

**A1: Schedule for Future Publication**
- At step 3, user clicks "Schedule" instead of "Publish"
- User selects future date and time (picker widget)
- System validates date is in future
- System sets published_at to selected timestamp
- System sets status to "scheduled"
- System enqueues background job to publish at scheduled time
- User sees confirmation: "Article scheduled for [date/time]"

**A2: Save as Draft**
- At step 3, user clicks "Save Draft"
- System saves article without changing status
- User remains on edit page
- System shows: "Draft saved at [time]"

**A3: Return to Editing**
- At step 2, user clicks "Continue Editing"
- User returns to edit form
- No changes are saved
- Draft auto-save continues in background

### Postconditions (Success):
- Article status is "published"
- Article is visible on public site at /articles/:slug
- Article appears in author's published articles list
- Article is indexed by search engine (Elasticsearch/PgSearch)
- Subscribers receive notification emails (queued)
- Article appears in RSS feed
- Social media cards are generated
- Analytics tracking is initialized

### Error Scenarios:

**E1: Validation Failure**
- System identifies validation errors
- System shows inline error messages:
  - "Title can't be blank"
  - "Body is too short (minimum 100 characters)"
- User remains on edit page
- Article status unchanged
- User can correct errors and retry

**E2: Authorization Failure**
- User doesn't own article (tampering attempt)
- System logs security event
- System shows 403 Forbidden page
- No changes made to article
- User redirected to their articles list

**E3: Database Error**
- Database connection fails during save
- System logs error with full stack trace
- System shows generic error message: "Unable to publish article. Please try again."
- Article status unchanged
- Admin receives error notification
- User can retry operation

**E4: Concurrent Modification**
- Another user edited article simultaneously
- System detects stale object (optimistic locking)
- System shows conflict warning with diff
- User can choose to override or merge changes
- Original version is preserved in history

### Business Rules:
- Only article owner or admin can publish
- Article must pass spam detection (Akismet)
- User must have verified email address
- Account must not be suspended
- Published articles cannot be unpublished (only archived)
- Scheduled articles can be edited before publication

### Performance Requirements:
- Publish action completes in < 500ms
- Page loads in < 2 seconds
- Notification sending (background) completes in < 5 minutes

### Security Considerations:
- CSRF token validation
- Strong parameters filtering
- HTML sanitization of body content
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention via ActiveRecord
```

## Estimation

### Velocity Tracking Example

```ruby
# Team Velocity Tracking

# Sprint 1: Committed 21 points, completed 18
# Sprint 2: Committed 20 points, completed 20
# Sprint 3: Committed 22 points, completed 19

# Average velocity: (18 + 20 + 19) / 3 = 19 points per sprint

# Planning next sprint:
# Conservative commitment: 19 points
# Realistic commitment: 19-21 points
# Stretch goal: 22 points

# Factors affecting velocity:
# - Team size changes
# - New team members (ramp-up time)
# - Technical debt paydown
# - Production incidents
# - Holidays/PTO
```

  ```bash
  # Add to crontab
  0 2 * * * /app/bin/backup_database.sh
  ```
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day
- **Priority:** IMMEDIATE (this week)
- **Owner:** DevOps

**C2: Unencrypted PII in Database**
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Impact:** GDPR/CCPA compliance violation, $20M potential fine
- **Current State:** users.ssn, users.phone stored as plaintext
- **Affected Records:** 15,000 users
- **Recommendation:**
  1. Add Lockbox gem for encryption
  2. Add Blind Index for searchability
  3. Migrate existing data (downtime required)
  4. Update queries to use blind index
- **Implementation:**
  ```ruby
  # Gemfile
  gem 'lockbox'
  gem 'blind_index'
  
  # Migration (estimated 30 minutes downtime)
  rails g lockbox:migration users ssn phone
  ```
- **Estimated Effort:** 3 days (including migration)
- **Priority:** Within 1 week
- **Owner:** Backend Lead + Security

**C3: Missing Rate Limiting on API**
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Impact:** DoS vulnerability, $5K+/month cost overrun potential
- **Current State:** /api/v1/* endpoints have no rate limiting
- **Recent Incidents:** 2 abuse cases in last month
- **Recommendation:**
  1. Add Rack::Attack gem

  3. Implement per-user limits (1000 req/hour)
  4. Add monitoring for rate limit hits
- **Implementation:**
  ```ruby
  # Gemfile
  gem 'rack-attack'
  
  # config/initializers/rack_attack.rb
  throttle('api/ip', limit: 100, period: 1.minute) do |req|
    req.ip if req.path.start_with?('/api/')
  end
  ```
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day
- **Priority:** Within 2 weeks
- **Owner:** Backend

---

### Performance Issues

**P1: N+1 Queries in Articles#index**
- **Location:** app/controllers/articles_controller.rb:12
- **Impact:** 50+ queries per page load, 2.5s response time
- **Expected:** < 5 queries, < 200ms response time
- **Fix:** Add `.includes(:author, :comments, :tags)`
- **Effort:** 1 hour
- **Testing:** Run with Bullet gem in test env

**P2: Missing Database Indexes**
- **Affected Tables:** 
  - articles.published_at (full table scan, 45K rows)
  - comments.article_id (slow joins)
  - tags.name (slow searches)
- **Impact:** Slow queries (500ms+) on large datasets
- **Fix:** 
  ```ruby
  add_index :articles, :published_at
  add_index :comments, :article_id
  add_index :tags, :name, unique: true
  ```
- **Effort:** 2 hours (includes testing on staging)

**P3: No Caching Strategy**
- **Impact:** Repeated expensive operations
- **Recommendation:**
  - Fragment caching for article lists
  - Russian doll caching for nested comments
  - HTTP caching with ETags
- **Effort:** 3 days

---

### Security Findings
